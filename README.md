# What is this for?

This is a simple script I made FOR MYSELF to rename my Strava titles
in chronological order. For example, the first activity would be #1, while the 100th
activity would be #100. This is such a specific problem I faced so I made this script for myself.
I use Strava's API for this and it's quite a dirty solution, i.e. there is no clean
app or interface to make this useful for other people to use.

Maybe one day I might clean it up and turn it into a usable app if other people face this problem.
Or just clone this repository and do it using the terminal if you have experience coding.
